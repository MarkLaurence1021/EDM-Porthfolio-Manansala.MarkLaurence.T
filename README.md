# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Mark Laurence T. Manansala, a first-year college student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS). My journey into the world of technology has been exciting, and I am eager to expand my knowledge in various aspects of computing. As I navigate through my studies, I have been introduced to the fundamentals of programming, particularly in the C language, which has sparked my interest in coding and problem-solving.  

I enjoy learning how to code and exploring different ways to improve my programming skills. Understanding how software works and applying logic to solve challenges keeps me motivated. Beyond coding, I have a strong passion for building computers. I find great satisfaction in assembling different components and optimizing them for performance, ensuring that every build meets the specific needs of its user.  

In my free time, I love playing on my computer, whether it's for gaming or exploring new software and technologies. Being hands-on with both hardware and software allows me to enhance my technical skills while also having fun. As I continue my studies, I look forward to gaining more knowledge and experience in the IT field, with the goal of developing my expertise in both software development and hardware systems.
